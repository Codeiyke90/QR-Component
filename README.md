## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

The major thing I learnt while working on this project is give **images** and **divs** a semi-round edges using **CSS property** called **border-radius**. 
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    img {
      border-radius: 15px;
    }
}
```
I am also proud I figured how to add **hover color** to text
```CSS
.proud-of-this-css {
     a:hover {
      color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    }
}
```
